            I was born on April 19 in College Station /Bryan, Texas. My birth mother 
            was 19 years old and gave brith to my full biological sister 14 months 
            before giving birth to me. My birth mother and father had known each other 
            since middle school but were not in a committed relationship. My biological
            father was in and out of jail/prison and from my understanding my bio 
            mother’s family wasn’t willing to help take care of another baby (me). I 
            spent 24 days with a foster family until my parents adopted me. My 
            biological family gave me by Native American and Mexican genetics while my
            parents raised me in a Turkish American culture. When I was 27 I found my
            biological family. Unfortunately, my bio mother’s new family doesn’t know 
            about me and therefore my bio mom wasn’t interested in having a relationship 
            with me. However, my bio mom told me more about my paternal side who accepted 
            me into their family with warm arms. I learned that my father has 6 children, 
            two of which I have met. In the picture to the right you can see my 
            biological grandma from my father’s side and his sister (my aunt), and me.

              When I married my husband my only condition was to adopt a child. After we
              had our first child we decided to look more into adoption. The adoption process
              was long and hard we waited 3 years before we had the chance to legally adopt 
              our child.
